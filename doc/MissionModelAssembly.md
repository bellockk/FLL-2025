    This will make it easier to pull off squares of duo-lock as needed.

1. On each square on the table that has an "X" in it (as shown in the following image), place a duo-lock square exactly in the square.  Be very careful to exactly position the duo-lock square on the square prior to moving to the next step.

    After placing the duo-lock square on the mat, you will be able to push it slightly around to adjust its location on the board.  If the duo-lock square is not within the square, remove it from the table and try again.

    ***Note: It is critical that you place each duo-lock square exactly over the square outlined on the table with the "X" through it.  If it is not perfect, remove it and try again.  If after repositioning the duo-lock square will not stick to the table, discard it.  Several extra duo-lock squares are included in the box.

1. Once the duo-lock square is exactly positioned, place your thumb on it and rock it back and forth with downward pressure to bond it to the table and remove any air bubbles between the glue and table.

1. Press down with your thumb evenly across the duo-lock square so that it "connects" to the glued down piece.  You will usually hear a "clicking" or "thunking" noise as it connects.

    ***Note: It is critical that you place each duo-lock square exactly over the glued down squares so they are perfectly lined up. If it is not perfect, remove it and try again.
