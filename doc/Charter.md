### Coach Profiles

#### OMMS Sponsor

This is a parent led club, but it would not be possible without Mrs. Hartman!  She coordinates the creation of the teams, and provides us with: a space to practice, robots, legos, and game boards.  Thank you Mrs. Hartman!!

#### Head Coach

My name is Ken Bellock, and I'll be the head coach for this season's FLL teams.  I have a B.S. in Mathematics and Physics from Penn State, and a M.S. in Geographic Information Systems from Johns Hopkins.  In the past I worked for the space program as a contractor designing ascent aborts scenarios for the Space Shuttle.  For my current job I lead a team of Embedded Software Engineers who automate tests on satellite systems before we deploy them to space.

#### Future Coaches

Coaching Help is Needed!
We have several returning assistant coaches this year, but we need more!  If you are interested in helping out with coaching please contact me and we can talk about how you can contribute.  Any and all help will be appreciated.  You do not need to know anything about coding or building with legos to help out, and we are required to have at least two coaches per team we field during competition.

### Meeting Schedule

Mondays 6-8pm except when the school is closed and on Halloween
Usually early after the new year we have competition (I do not know dates yet) If we win a bracket, we move up and will have another day of competition.
Before competition we will meet on the weekends at a coach or parents house to develop our robot game and presentation.  These are not required meetings, but are a lot of fun and very helpful for last minute preparations for competion.

Game Rules

Have Fun!

Students must do ALL of the work, coaches only provide guidance

Competition consists of the robot challenge, a core values presentation, a conversation with judges about robot design, and an innovation project presentation

### Interesting Notes

We are competing against over 35k teams through multiple brackets

We have never made it to the next level, but last year one of our teams got real close, and every year we get better

### Required Commitment

FLL is a team sport.  Missing a meeting will hurt your team just like any other team sport.

If you are not sure yet if you want to commit, please keep coming to the next several meetings to help decide.

A commitment should be made by early October as that is when we will create the teams that will work together until competition.

If you have days you know you will miss, please let us know as far in advance as possible.

If too many days are missed, a critical role on competition day cannot be guaranteed.

### Behavioral and Team Work Expectations aka "Gracious Professionalism"

It's more than just good sportsmanship, it's treating our teammates and opponents with respect, cooperation and professional behavior including produtive communication skills.  Words matter.
Part of the robot competition score is an evaluation of behavior.
To practice on getting the highest score for this part of the evaluation we are going to practice "Gracious Professionalism" at all of our team meetings.

Finally, any major incidents that threaten the safety or well being of any team member or coach may result in immediate suspension from the club.  Team members who display and escalate behaviors that involve name calling, bad language, bullying, puposeful destruction of robots or supplies, theft or physical altercations may be released immediatly from FLL club participation.

### Laptops

OMMS pays for registration, Legos, robots, and gives us space to practice, but the laptops we are currently using have been donated.
We could use a few more laptops if anyone has old laptops that are not being used.
If you have laptops you do not use anymore, please consider donating them to the team. They can be old, but must be working.  Any donated laptops will not be returned after the season ends.
Students can bring their own laptops, but we will not be responsible for lost, stolen or broken laptops.
I will send out instructions on how students can contribute from home if they would like to.
Any donated laptops will be wiped clean and we will reinstall the operating system and the Lego software

### Phones

No phones are allowed out during meetings. You can bring them, but you cannot have them out unless messaging a parent or guardian.

### What Else To Bring To Meetings

Send water bottles and snacks if you like

### Fees

There are no registration or participation fees, but we will likely take a collection as competition nears to get team shirts made.  (If you can make or design shirts and are willing, please let us know.)  Thank you to Jacen Scarberry's family who kindly helped us last year!

### Final Notes

Legos, robots, missions and boards stay at school

If you have any questions please let me know.  You can email me or we can talk before or after meetings.
