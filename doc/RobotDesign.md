# [Robot Design](../README.md)

The robot build, programming and mission execution description.

## Build

Started with a spike prime robot the club used two years ago, but modified it to use three wheels instead of 4 for stability on tables that are not perfectly flat.  Also, added a second forklift and customized attachments for this years missions.

### Attachments

Attachments used by the team to accomplish this years missions.

#### Forklift

#### Plow

## Programming

Programming is being done using Python in Visual Studio Code using the PyBricks library.  The Lego Education Edition Software can be used to write and run python code, but it saves in a file format that is not text.  This makes it difficult to share the code across laptops and merge code developed by different members of the team.  To simplify the programming process, the coach worked with the team to create a wrapper to simplify the code to the most simplistic steps we needed to do when completing missions.  For example, drive forward a set distance, turn left or right by a given angle, and to work the attachment motors.

No light sensors were used this year though they are left on the robot.
